(Manual cut of standard Chickiboom neck fret slots. Written by Tony Diethelm. Revisions managed with Git.)

(We are using the rule of 17.817)
(Divide scale length by 17.817. That's your first fret position.)
(Just keep doing it again and again. :D)
(We will have to manage our X position, as we are cutting on a pre done neck.)


(divide scale length by 17.817)
(subtract from scale length)
(cut there, new scale length)
(redo!)
(Oh, but skip certain frets)



(set everything up.)

G017	(XY plane)
G21  	(metric)
G90	(absolute programming)
F1000	(feed rate 1000mm/min)
S1	(spindle speed 1rev/min. We don't use spindle speeds, but needed for router to turn on.)
G00 Z35 (safe Z)




(use #1-#33 as local variables)

#1 = [24.25]	(desired scale length in inches)
#2 = [#1*25.4]	(multiply by 25.4 to convert to mm.)
#3 = 		(position of the center of the nut.)




(Set up the subroutine for slot cutting)

o<SLOTCUTS> SUB
G00 Z#5			(bit up)
G00 X#4 Y#2 Z#5		(safely drive to beginning)
M3 G01 Z#6		(router on, bit down)

(set up a WHILE loop to do gross cuts.)
(WHILE starting/current X is less than target-#1-1, go to #4, go across, come back, increment #4 by #8.)

#11 = 0
o101 WHILE [#4 LT [#10-#1-#7]] 
	G01 X#4		(go to current/starting X)
	o102 IF #11 EQ 0
		G01 Y#3		(go across)
		#11 = 1		(We are now high, next rep needs to come back)
	o102 ELSE
		G01 Y#2		(come back)
		#11 = 0		(We are now low, next rep needs to go across)
	o102 ENDIF
	#4 = [#4+#8]	(increment the X position)
o101 ENDWHILE 

G00 Y#2		(come back, fast. Needed to reset Y so the rest of this works with minimal logic.)
#4 = [#9+#1]	(final cut, lower end, set X)
G00 X#4		(go to lower end)
G01 Y#3		(go across)
#4 = [#10-#1]	(final cut, high end, set X)
G00 X#4		(go to high end)
G01 Y#2		(come back)

G00 Z#5	M5	(bit up, stop router)
o<SLOTCUTS> ENDSUB
